# Tourism-TL-Corrolation

The project aimed to test the hypothesis that the depreciation of the Turkish lira leads to an increase in tourism in Turkey. The project utilized data related to the number of tourists from various countries visiting Turkey, exchange rates of currencies (such as the Russian ruble, euro, and British pound), and the Turkish Consumer Price Index (CPI) to analyze the correlation between the Turkish lira's value and tourism.

The project involved the use of Python programming language and several libraries such as pandas, openpyxl, and matplotlib for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. The data was sourced from Excel files containing information about tourist arrivals from different countries, exchange rates, and CPI values.

The project first focused on analyzing the overall trend in tourist numbers over the years. It visualized the data using line graphs to show the number of tourists visiting Turkey annually. The graphs were further enhanced with labels, gridlines, and customized tick labels.

Next, the project examined the relationship between the number of tourists from specific countries (e.g., Russia, Germany, and the UK) and the exchange rates of their respective currencies (e.g., ruble, euro, and British pound). Bar charts were used to represent the number of tourists, while line graphs illustrated the exchange rates. The graphs aimed to visualize any potential correlation between currency exchange rates and tourist numbers.

Furthermore, the project analyzed the Turkish CPI and its effect on the Turkish lira's value. A line graph was used to display the shift in the Turkish CPI over time, indicating the changes in the Turkish lira's purchasing power.

The project also included hypothesis testing to assess the significance of the relationship between the Turkish lira's depreciation and tourism. A statistical test, such as a correlation analysis or regression analysis, may have been conducted to determine the strength and significance of the relationship. The p-value, which measures the probability of obtaining the observed results by chance, would have been calculated. The exact details of the hypothesis testing and the p-value were not provided in the project summary.

Lastly, the project investigated the top nationalities of tourists visiting Turkey. It processed the data to identify the top 30 nationalities and represented their respective proportions using a pie chart.

In conclusion, the project provided a comprehensive analysis of the correlation between the Turkish lira's depreciation, exchange rates, and tourism in Turkey. By utilizing various data visualization techniques, it presented clear insights into the relationship between these factors. The project's findings and visualizations can be helpful for policymakers, economists, and stakeholders in the tourism industry to understand and analyze the impact of currency depreciation on tourism in Turkey.
